*Figure 1: The quantum ready solution for drug discovery architecture on AWS*

This solution deploys the Amazon CloudFormation template in your AWS Cloud account and completes the following settings.

The AWS CloudFormation template deploys the following workflows and service:

* Notebook Experiment 
    1. The user deploys the solution into their AWS account and 
    open the deployed [AWS SageMaker Notebook](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html). The user can run and study sample 
    codes for drug discovery, following the step-by-step guide in **ZAY workshop md**
    2. When the user want to modify the default algorithms and update the 
    images of [Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) for the 
    following batch test, they can find the step-by-step guide in **ZAY deployment md**
* Batch Test

    1. The user can open the deployed [AWS Step Function](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) for batch test the same problem 
    in drug discovery using classical computers and quantum computers. 
    2. The AWS Step Function launches various classical computing tasks through [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) jobs based on different resources.
    3. AWS Batch save results to [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).
    4. At the same time as step 2, AWS Step Function parallelly launches various quantum computing tasks based on different quantum computing devices.
    5. Each batch job asynchronously submits the quantum computing jobs/tasks 
    through [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/)
    6. When quantum computing jobs/tasks complete, the results are saved to 
    Amazon S3. 
    7. [Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) triggers 
    the lisener [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
    8. The lisener lambda sends a callback token to the step function
    9. When all the steps complete, a SNS notification is send out by 
    [Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/).
    10. The Athena table is created by [Amazon Athena](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/)
     based on metrics data in Amazon S3.
    11. The user can view the batch test results(e.g. cost, performance and time) 
    through [Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/)
