Deploying this solution with the default parameters builds the following environment in the AWS Cloud.

*Figure 1: The quantum ready solution for drug discovery architecture on AWS*

This solution deploys the Amazon CloudFormation template in your 
AWS Cloud account and provides three URLs. One for **Visualization**.
The others provide user with two approaches to study drug discovery 
problems: **Notebook Experiment** and **Batch Evaluation**:

1. The solution deploys an instance for 
[AWS SageMaker Notebook](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/nbi.html). 
The user can do **Notebook Experiment** for drug discovery on classical computing and 
quantum computing in this notebook.

2. The notebook comes with prepared sample code for different problems 
in drug discovery, like molecular unfolding, molecule simulation and so on. 
The user can learn how to study these problems based on classical 
or quantum computing resource through 
[Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/). The step-by-step guide is 
provided in the [Workshop Page](workshop/background.md).

3. The notebook provides the user with the public network access to download 
necessary software for experiments.


4. The solution also deploys 
[AWS Step Function](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/) for user to do 
**Batch Evaluation**. 

5. The AWS Step Function launches various computing tasks through 
    [AWS Batch](https://aws.amazon.com/batch/) jobs based on different resources.

6. Instances launched by AWS Batch try to evaluate a particular problem based 
on different computing resources , classical computing or quantum computing. 
For example, for the problem of molecular unfolding, the performance difference 
between quantum annealer and simulated annealer can be compared. 

7. The images for **Batch Evaluation** have been built in 
[Amazon ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/). For customizing
the logic for **Batch Evaluation**, please refer to 
[Batch Evaluate Your Own Model Page](workshop/a-molecule-unfolding/test-your-own-model.md).

8. The **Batch Evaluation** deploys [VPC Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints.html) to ensure secure connection to AWS 
services:
Amazon ECR, Amazon S3, Amazon Braket.

9. The batch job for testing quantum algorithm submits the quantum computing 
jobs/tasks through Amazon Braket.

10. Either classical computing task or quantum computing jobs/tasks complete, 
the results will be saved to 
[Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/),

11. When quantum computing jobs/tasks complete, 
[Amazon EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/) triggers
the listener [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

12. The listener lambda sends a callback to the step function.

13. When all the steps complete, a notification is send out by 
[Amazon SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/).

14. The Glue table is created by Amazon Athena based on metrics data in 
Amazon S3.

15. The user can view the **Batch Evaluation** results(e.g. cost, performance) 
through [Amazon QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/)
