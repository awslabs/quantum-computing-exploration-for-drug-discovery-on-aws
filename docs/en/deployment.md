## Deployment

### Step1: Check your QuickSight

* Sign in to the AWS Management Console, navigate to
[QuickSight](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/)

* If you did not have a QuickSight account, you need to sign up for QuickSight(you need Administrator permission to sign up, [doc](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/setting-up-create-iam-user.html)).

* Choose **Enterprise**, click continue

* In the **Create your QuickSight account** page, fill the necessary information:

### Step2: Deploy solution

This automated AWS CloudFormation template deploys the solution in the AWS Cloud.

* Use 
[Launch solution in AWS Standard Regions](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-west-2#/stacks/new?stackName=qrsdd-stack) to launch the AWS CloudFormation template.

* The template launches in the US West 2 (Oregon) Region by default. To launch this solution in a different AWS Region, use the Region selector in the console navigation bar.

* On the **Create stack** page, verify that the correct [quantum-ready-solution-for-drug-discovery.template](template.md) is shown in the **Amazon S3 URL** text box and choose **Next**.

* Under **Parameters**, review the parameters for the template and modify them as necessary. This solution uses the following values. Choose **Next**.

<center>

|      Parameter      |   Description |
|:-------------------:|:----:|
| QuickSightUser | **QuickSight Username** |

</center>

* On the **Configure stack options** page, choose **Next**.

* On the **Review** page, review and confirm the settings. Check the box acknowledging that the template will create AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources.

* Choose **Create stack** to deploy the stack.

You can view the status of the stack in the AWS CloudFormation Console in the **Status** column. You should receive a CREATE_COMPLETE status in approximately 10 minutes.

### Step3: Update QuickSight permissions


* Navigate to QuickSight [admin page](https://us-east-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/admin#aws)
