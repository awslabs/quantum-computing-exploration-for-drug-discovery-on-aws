Before you launch the solution, review the architecture, supported regions, and other considerations discussed in this guide. Follow the step-by-step instructions in this section to configure and deploy the solution into your account.

**Time to deploy**: Approximately 10 minutes

!!! notice "Note"

    Before deploying this solution, we recommend you [create a billing alarm to monitor your estimated AWS charges](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/monitor_estimated_charges_with_cloudwatch.html). 


## Deployment Overview

- Step 1: Make preparations
    - Enable Amazon Braket service
    - Create IAM Role for QuickSight
    - Sign up for QuickSight
    - Obtain QuickSight Username

- Step 2: Launch the AWS CloudFormation template into your AWS account
- Step 3: Subscribe to SNS notification (optional)


## Step 1: Make preparations

### Enable Amazon Braket service

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console, and search for Amazon Braket.

2. Access the Amazon Braket console, and select **I have read and accepted the above terms & conditions**.

3. Choose **Enable Amazon Braket**.

### Create IAM Role for QuickSight

1. Navigate to [IAM Policies](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iamv2/home?#/policies).

2. Choose **Create Policy**.

3. In the Create policy page, click the **JSON** tab, and enter the QuickSight policy as below. This is the least policy required for QuickSight to work in this solution.

### Sign up for QuickSight

!!! notice "Note"
     
     You must have correct AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) permissions to sign up for QuickSight. Refer to [Signing up for an Amazon QuickSight subscription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/signing-up.html) for details.


1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console, and navigate to [QuickSight](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/).

2. Choose **Enterprise**, and click continue.

3. In the **Create your QuickSight account** page, complete the following settings. 

    - Choose **Use IAM federated identities & QuickSight-managed users** from the Authentication method.
    - Choose **US East (N.Virginia)**.
    - Enter the unique **QuickSight account name**.
    - Enter the **Email** to receive notifications.
    - Choose **Use an existing role**, and select the role: `qradd-quicksight-service-role`.


    !!! Caution "Caution"

        If Quicksight service already used default role, you need to change it to the role created above in the page [QuickSight Security & permissions](https://us-east-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/admin#aws). Please check in advance because this operation may influence other data under this QuickSight Account. Refer to [Using Amazon QuickSight with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security-create-iam-role) for details.

### Obtain QuickSight Username

1. Go to [QuickSight Admin](https://us-east-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/admin).

2. Record your **QuickSight Username** (not QuickSight account name) for your email.

    !!! Caution "Caution"

            If QuickSight user is not created for your current AWS account, you need to navigate to [QuickSight](https://quicksight.aws.amazon.com/) and enter your email address.

## Step 2: Launch the AWS CloudFormation template into your AWS account

1. Sign in to the AWS management console, and select the [Launch Stack][template-url] button to launch the AWS CloudFormation template. Alternatively, you can download the template as a starting point for your own implementation.
 
2. The template launches in the US West (Oregon) by default. To launch this solution in a different AWS Region (for example `us-east-1`), use the Region selector in the console navigation bar.

3. On the **Create stack** page, verify that Amazon S3 URL is filled with this [template URL][cf-template-url] automatically and choose **Next**.

4. Under **Parameters**, review the parameters for the template and modify them as necessary. This solution uses the following values. 


    |      Parameter      |   Description |
    |:-------------------|:----|
    | QuickSightUser | QuickSight Username, which can be obtained from [Manage users](https://us-east-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/admin?#users). |
    | QuickSightRoleName | QuickSight Service Role name, which can be obtained from [Security & permissions](https://us-east-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/admin?#aws).|

5. Choose **Next**.

6. On the **Configure stack options** page, choose **Next**.

7. On the **Review** page, review and confirm the settings. Check the box acknowledging that the template will create AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) resources.

8. Choose **Create stack** to deploy the stack.

You can view the status of the stack in the AWS CloudFormation Console in the **Status** column. You should receive a **CREATE_COMPLETE** status in approximately 10 minutes.

## Step 3: Subscribe to SNS notification (optional)

Follow below steps to subscribe to SNS notification via Email. You may also subscribe to the notification via [text messages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-mobile-phone-number-as-subscriber.html).

1. Obtain your SNS topic name in the CloudFormation deployment output.

    ![SNS name](./images/deploy-output-sns.png)

2. Navigate to [SNS topics](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/v3/home?region=us-east-1#/topics).

3. Click the SNS topic that you obtained from the CloudFormation deployment output.

4. Choose **Create subscription**.

5. Select Email from the **Protocol** list.

6. Enter your email in **Endpoint**.

7. Choose **Create subscription**.

8. Check the inbox of your email to see that you have received an email, and click the **Confirm Subscription** link to confirm the subscription.
