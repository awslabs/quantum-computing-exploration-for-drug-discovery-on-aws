When you build systems on AWS infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and AWS. This [shared model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) reduces your operational burden because AWS operates, manages, and controls the components including the host operating system, the virtualization layer, and the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate. For more information about AWS security, visit [AWS Cloud Security](http://aws.amazon.com/security/).

## Security groups

The security groups created in this solution are designed to control and isolate network traffic between the solution components. We recommend that you review the security groups and further restrict access as needed once the deployment is up and running.

## Amazon Braket Security
