You are responsible for the cost of Amazon cloud technology services used when running this solution. As of January 2022, the estimated cost for the solution 
is 25.12 USD per day.

The whole cost consists of five types:

 * Notebook
 * Compute 
 * Storage
 * Analysis
 * Orchestration

 The actual cost depends on the tasks performed and the complexity. Take 
 the molecular unfolding function for the prepared sample (117_idel.mol2) as 
 an example. The following calculation is based on that customers use 
 the notebook to study sample code as well as use the solution to run 
 one complete batch test both on quantum computing resource and classical computing 
 resource in order to visualize the results in Amazon QuickSight. If the 
 customers only used solution to study the sample code, the cost for 
 notebook and the compute from Amazon Braket were considered.
