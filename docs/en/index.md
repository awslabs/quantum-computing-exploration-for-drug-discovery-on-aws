AWS Quantum Ready Solution for Drug Discovery (AWS QRSDD) helps customers 
study drug discovery problems using quantum computing (Amazon Braket), 
such as molecular docking and protein folding. Customers can easily 
leverage this solution to orchestrate workflows that run on both classical 
and quantum as needed.

This solution mainly includes the following features:

- Launch a hybrid solution architecture with just 1-click, including quantum computing and 
classical computing workflow
- Flexibility for customers to use either quantum or classical compute resource or both in HPC architecture
- Sample codes to show how to use quantum computing, classical computing or both to study the drug discovery problems 
- The analytics data and diagrams are provided in BI service (Amazon QuickSight) to evaluate the experiment values (e.g. cost, performance, time)

This implementation guide describes architectural considerations and configuration steps for deploying the quantum ready solution for drug discovery in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud. It includes links to [CloudFormation][cloudformation] templates that launches and configures the AWS services required to deploy this solution using AWS best practices for security and availability.

The guide is intended for IT architects, developers, DevOps, data scientists, and algorithm engineers with practical experience architecting in the AWS Cloud.
