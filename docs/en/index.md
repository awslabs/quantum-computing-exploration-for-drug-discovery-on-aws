# Background

This deployment guide describes in detail how to deploy Keycloak on the cloud using the AWS CloudFormation template to build a Keycloak on AWS highly available architecture.

# Solution Description

Keycloak's containers are deployed and run on [AWS Fargate](https://amazonaws-china.com/fargate/), and with AWS Fargate, you do not need to pre-populate and manage container instances. To ensure high system availability, the [Amazon ECS](https://amazonaws-china.com/ecs/) service defines two tasks so that if one task fails to provide service, the other task can still provide service to the public.

In addition, this solution uses [Amazon RDS](https://amazonaws-china.com/rds/) as the system database to store Keycloak's configuration and user information. To ensure high availability and information security of the system. By default, [Amazon RDS Multi-Availability Zone Deployment Method](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/rds/features/multi-az/) is used, and the database runs in each availability zone and has been designed to have high reliability. In the event of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS automatically fails over to a standby instance so you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. In addition, the solution also supports the option of [Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/rds/aurora/serverless/) database clustering, where Amazon Aurora Serverless automatically starts, shuts down, and scales based on application Amazon Aurora Serverless automatically starts up, shuts down, and scales up or down depending on the needs of the application, allowing you to run databases in the cloud without having to manage any database instances.

Regardless of the database type selected, the default database password is automatically generated and stored in [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/secrets-manager/) at the time of deployment.

# Usage Scenarios

Keycloak is an out-of-the-box open source identity and access control software that provides single sign-on (SSO) functionality and supports OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML 2.0 standard protocols. Customizable user interface for login, registration, administration and account management. In addition, users can integrate Keycloak with [Amazon Cognito](https://amazonaws-china.com/cognito/) or with other existing LDAP and [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) servers for integration. Users can also delegate authentication to third-party identity providers.

## System Architecture

## Components

### Amazon ECS

- This solution runs Amazon ECS clusters using AWS Fargate, which is a serverless computing service for containers. With AWS Fargate, you don't need to on-premises and manage servers, and you can assign and pay for resources for each application and improve security by designing to isolate applications.

- To ensure high system availability, two tasks are defined in the Amazon ECS service so that if one task fails to provide service, the other task continues to provide service.

- Amazon ECS supports Docker and enables you to run and manage Docker containers. Keycloak's container images are deployed and run on Amazon ECS without any configuration changes.


### Amazon ECR

- Used to store Keycloak's Docker image files.
### Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM)
- SSL Certificate in Https listener (TLS: 443) for ALB.

### Amazon Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- Cognito Identity pool for user authentication in conjunction with Keycloak. There can be two Roles, one owned by users who are not logged in and one owned by users who are logged in, and depending on the Policy owned by the Role, users can access different AWS services.

### Amazon Route 53

- Used for domain name resolution and ACM certificate creation authentication.

### Amazon RDS

- The database type is Amazon RDS for MySQL.
- The default database instance type is db.r5.large.
- Default uses Amazon RDS Multi-Available Zone deployment.
- The default automatic backup is 7 days.
- KMS encryption is enabled by default.
- Option to use Amazon Aurora Serverless
- Optionally use a single Amazon RDS instance

### AWS Secrets Manager
- Automatically generates and stores the initial username and password for the Keycloak administrator account
- Automatically generates and stores initial administrator account username, password, and connection domain and port information for the database

## Deployment Instructions

## Deployment prerequisites

1. the domain name has been recorded by ICP and used to apply for ACM certificate.
2. the certificate of the domain name is created in ACM and verified by the domain name.
3. VPC with 4 subnets (including two public subnets and two private subnets) and NAT Gateway.

## Create ACM certificate

In order to ensure that Keycloak can connect to the Cognito Identity pool, it is necessary to ensure that Keycloak provides in HTTPS service. This means that an ACM certificate or a third-party certificate must be used. For details on how to use it, please refer to.
[How to upload an SSL certificate and import it into AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/cn/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/import-ssl-certificate-to-iam/)

This deployment guide illustrates the use of AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) as an example. For more information about ACM, see https://aws.amazon.com/cn/certificate-manager/

First, log in to the ACM console.

![](images/acm1.png)

Click the **[Request a certificate]** button.

Select the **[Request a public certificate]** radio box.

Then click the **[Request Certificate]** button.

![](images/acm2.png)

In the **[Add domain name]** input box in **[Add domain name]**, enter the domain name to be used for the Keycloak service.

![](images/acm3.png)

Click **[Next]** .

Select **[Verify by DNS]** .

![](images/acm4.png)

Add tags

![](images/acm5.png)

Click the **[Review]** button.

![](images/acm6.png)


Please record the values of the **[Name]** **[Type]** and **[Value]** fields, which need to be used later in Route53 to add the recordset. Click the **[Continue]** button.

## Authentication Domain

Add a Cname record to Route 53 to authenticate that the domain name is owned and available to you. First, go to the Route 53 administration page and click on your domain name.
If no hosted zone has been created, refer to https://aws.amazon.com/cn/route53/


![](images/route53-1.png)

Click **[Create Record Set]** and enter the **[Name]** **[Type]** and **[Value]** fields recorded in the ACM authentication step in the **[Name]** input box on the right window.

![](images/route53-2.png)

When you are done adding them. Go back to the ACM interface and wait for about 5 minutes. Click the Refresh button. Wait for the status of ACM certificate to change to **[Issued]**.

![](images/route53-3.png)

At this point, the ACM certificate has been applied.
Please make a note of the ARN string marked by the orange box in the image above. This value will be used as an input value in Cloudformation. For example.

`arn:aws-cn:acm:cn-northwest-1:12345678901:certificate/032b2d8f-e3b5-4027-aaef-b894dae000f5`

### About how to modify the IAM Role

When creating a Cognito Identity Pool, you need to specify two roles (Role), one is the **[Role]** that logged-in users have and the other is the **[Role]** that non-logged-in users have. If you have not set up either of these Roles, please create them in the IAM console. For more information on how to create a Role and related roles, please refer to: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html
