</center>

* Experiments hist table

In this sheet, you can view the batch evaluation result by each experiment, rows in the experiments table is clickable, you can click the row to view the result only for that experiment.

* Task count chart
    * It shows total tasks count of the experiment if you select an experiment in **Experiments hist** table.
    * It shows total tasks count of all experiments if no experiment is selected.

* QC vs. CC charts

    Below two charts show the performance of QC vs. CC tasks

    Figure 10: Performance of CC v.s. QC
    </center>
    
    * **QC vs. CC average**  - compares the average execution time (Y-axis) of QC and CC tasks by different model parameters (X-axis)
     * **QC vs. CC by resource**  - compares the execution time (Y-axis) of QC and CC tasks by different model parameters (X-axis) using different resources(for QC that is different QPU devices, for CC that is different memory-vCPU)
    
* QC: by devices chart 

    It compares execution time (Y-axis) of different QPU devices by different model parameters (X-axis)

    <center>
    ![dashboard qc device](../../images/quicksight-qc-device.png)

* Records table
   
    It lists the detail information of each task in the selected experiment (if no experiment selected, it lists all)

    <center>
    ![dashboard records table](../../images/quicksight-records-table.png)

    Figure 13: Dashboard records table
    </center>

    Fields in this table:

    * **compute_type**: compute type, CC or QC
    * **resource**: resource name, for QC that is different QPU devices, for CC that is different memory-vCPU
    * **param**: model parameters. **M**: number of torsions; **D**: angle precision of rotation; **HQ**: hubo-qubo value, energy penalty; **A**: penalty scalar
    * **opt_params**: optimizer parameters
    * **task_duration**: task execution time in seconds
    * **time_info**: for QC, different dimensions of QC task time, `total_time` is the **task_duration** , for CC, `local_time` is the **task_duration**
    * **execution_id**: the Step Functions execution id
    * **experiment_name**: the experiment name, if input `experimentName` is not empty, it is `execution start time + input experimentName`, otherwise, it is `execution start time + execution_id`
    * **task_id**: for Qc task, it is Braket task id, for CC, it is empty
    * **result_detail**: the volume size of molecule before and after unfolding
    * **result_location**: the molecule mol2 file after unfolding


#### Sheet 2: view result by each resource

In this sheet, you can view batch evaluation result by each resource and QPU device

<center>
![by resource sheet](../../images/quicksight-by-resource.png)

</center>

* Compute type and resource table
   
    It lists all resources in batch evaluation, for QC - resources are QPU devices, for CC - resources are memory and vCPU. Items in the table are clickable, when you click one item (meaning you select it),  metrics in this sheet are switched to that item. If no item selected, it shows averaged metrics.


* Experiment hist chart
    
    It shows execution time (Y-axis) for selected resource by experiment name (X-axis, ordered by time) using different model parameters.

### Input specification

You can customize parameters of the evaluation by using a json input.

The input schema:

```json
{
    "version": "string",
    "runMode": "string",
    "molFile": "string",
    "modelVersion": "string",
    "experimentName": "string",
    "optParams": {
        "qa": {
            "shots": "int"
        },
        "sa": {
            "shots": "int"
        }
    },
    "modelParams": {
        "M": "int []",
        "D": "int []"
    },
    "devicesArns": "string []",
    "ccResources": "[int, int] []",
}

```

!!! notice

    all fields are optional.

Definition:

  * **version**:  the version of input schema, current only support value is: '1'
  * **runMode**:  run mode, value can be `ALL`, `CC` or `QC`, default: 'ALL'; `CC` - only run CC tasks, `QC` only run QC tasks, `ALL` - run both tasks
  * **molFile**: S3 url of the mol2 file
  * **modelVersion**: model version, default: 'latest'
  * **experimentName**: the name of the batch evaluation
  * **optParams**: the optimizer parameters, set shots for QC(qa) and CC(sa) tasks respectively
  * **modelParams**: model parameters, M: number of torsions, D: angle precision of rotation. Please refer to [Notebook Experiment](./notebook-experiment.md) for detail.  Valid values: 

         M: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
         D: [4] or [8]

!!! notice

    The max value of M is depended on the value of D, QPU device and input molFile, we set max M to 100 in input validation. If the value exceeds the device capacity in actual running, the execution will be failed.
    
    If you use your own molFile, the input validation will be skipped, if the value exceeds the device capacity, the execution will be failed. 
   
  * **devicesArns**: QPU device arn. Valid values:
  
        arn:aws:braket:::device/qpu/d-wave/DW_2000Q_6
        arn:aws:braket:::device/qpu/d-wave/Advantage_system4
      
  * **ccResources**: memory(first element) in GiB and vCPU(second element), e.g. 4GiB memory and 2 vCPU is: `[4, 2]`

```json
{
    "version": "1",
