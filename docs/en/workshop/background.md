# Workshop Background

Quantum Ready Architecture For Drug Discovery is a cloud-native solution for the application of quantum computing technology to drug discovery. This solution tries to bridge the gap between the actual industrial practices and the novel computation model provided by the quantum technologies, and will continue to implement the Proof of Concepts (PoC) based on the latest publications or reports. It is an open-source project, and anyone can contribute code to add more features.

Drug discovery problems fall into the biology category, which is one of the science categories directly impacted by quantum computing technology. The quantum computing technology is still in an early phase, and its true impact may not even be fully understood yet. However, we are entering a fascinating period in the development of quantum computing. It is worthwhile to start experimenting with quantum computers, cut though the hype, compare different technologies, and explore if and when quantum computing will matter for businesses. If interested, refer to [Quantum computing use cases](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chuckbrooks/2021/03/21/the-emerging-paths-of-quantum-computing/?sh=765b2ed6613e). 

Drug discovery comes with high risks and is time-consuming. As shown in Figure 1, the average R&D cost required to bring a new, FDA approved medicine to patients is estimated to be $2.6 billion over the past decade (in 2013 dollars). This includes the cost of many potential medicines that do not make it through to FDA approval. For example, in research for treatments for Alzheimer’s disease over the past 16 years, only four new medicines have been approved for Alzheimer’s out of 123 treatment attempts that were tested in clinical studies. That’s a 3 percent approval rate.

To tackle with those problems, innovation and advancements in computer-aided drug design (CADD) is introduced to help increase the productivity in drug research and development. 

As shown in Figure 2, CADD has both the structured-based methods and ligand-based methods. Researchers have listed the quantum techniques that can be applied to the components in the general workflow of drug discovery process, for example, VQE ban be applied to molecular docking.

We do not yet have all the resources required to build the perfect computer, like Fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) as shown in Figure 3, but Amazon Braket already provides access to Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing (NISQ). It is right time for customers at the forefront of innovations in their fields to start with quantum computing to research application, to build expertise, and secure Intellectual Property (IP).
